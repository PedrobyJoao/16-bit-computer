#### HalfAdder and FullAdder
This is something that I kinda already knew from my past experience reading "Code - Charles Petzold".

But something new that I have to add is a new technic to build chips. What I can do if I already know
at least a half of the logic gates and order of them to be used, I can draw the gates and try with different
inputs. This makes easy to discover the rest of the chips to be used through the chip.
