# Building a mini computer (hardware and software)
Through the exercises and guide of the book "The elements of computing systems" (by Noam Nisan e Shimon Schocken), I'm in practice building a mini and simple computer. 

### Hardware
I'm not totally aware yet which will be the tools to virtualize the hardware part on my physical computer but I'm designing the chips with HDL (Hardware Description Language) and I'm using a hardware simulator for testing.
